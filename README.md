DotSnap
=======

DotSnap helps you to finally see your beautiful desktop wallpaper again. Quickly change your default screenshot folder where ever you are, as well as give your screenshots a real name even before you take them to stay organized. 

- Set your default folder once, or change it as often as you want with quick access in your top bar. 

- Give your screenshots a default prefix name, or change it as often as you want. We even save your 5 last used names. Optional add a date stamp to it.
